Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.\n\n###And why is this a separate module?\n\nI'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.","maintainers":[{"name":"feedic","email":"me@feedic.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-02-15T14:44:50.619Z","created":"2014-02-15T14:44:50.619Z","1.0.0":"2014-02-15T14:44:50.620Z"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
